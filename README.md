# DiverseAR Datasets
This repository accompanies the workshop paper "_Advancing the Understanding and Evaluation of AR-Generated Scenes: When Vision-Language Models Shine and Stumble_", submitted to GenAI-XR 2025. It introduces **DiverseAR**, a dataset of 318 images collected from two commercial AR platforms (Amazon and Scaniverse), three AR applications (HoloLens) previously developed by our lab, and two AR applications (Apple Vision Pro and Android) specifically created for this project.

_Creation:_ To evaluate the AR scene understanding capabilities of VLMs, we curated the DiverseAR dataset, specifically designed to capture a broad spectrum of AR scenarios. The dataset consists of 298 AR images collected from diverse sources and environments. It includes 23 images captured using a custom-developed Apple Vision Pro AR application in laboratory and kitchen environments, and 151 images collected from a custom-developed Android AR application in bedroom and dining room environments. Additionally, 42 images were created in-house to explore AR-specific research topics, such as attention patterns, task-detrimental virtual content arrangements, and AR applications in surgical guidance. The dataset also features 7 images of glass objects obtained from the Amazon app's AR View, and 46 images collected from the Scaniverse app's AR View, captured in laboratory, kitchen, and dining room environments. Finally, 29 images were sourced from a website showcasing AR advertisement videos. Additionally, we included 20 non-AR images to supplement the dataset. This comprehensive collection ensures the DiverseAR dataset supports robust analysis of AR scene understanding. 

The DiverseAR dataset encompasses a wide spectrum of AR and non-AR scenarios, showcasing diverse characteristics of both virtual and real-world content. Table below summarizes the key characteristics represented in the dataset, while Figure below illustrates representative examples of these characteristics. The dataset includes single or multiple instances of identical and varied real and virtual objects across various AR images. These objects span numerous classes, including toys, food, shoes, plants, laptops, containers, and more.
